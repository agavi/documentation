    <section>
      <title>Transformation to PDF and Word RTF</title>
      <ol>
        <li>You can change the styles of the output file by using tools in <tm trademark="Microsoft" tmowner="Microsoft Corporation" tmtype="reg" tmclass="special">Microsoft</tm> Word rather than specifying the styles before transforming.</li>
        <li>If there is a cross reference referring to an URL in the DITA source file, the link should be completed defined with the proper internet protocol. For example, specify <userinput>http://www.ibm.com</userinput> instead of <userinput>www.ibm.com</userinput>.</li>
        <li>Flagging, revision bar and filtering are not supported in PDF and Word RTF output.</li>
        <li>Morerows attribute of the table element used to generating vertically merged cell is not supported in PDF output.</li>
        <li>Style attributes for table are not supported in Word RTF output.</li>

    <section>
      <title>HTML to DITA migration</title>
      <ol>
        <li>Since Xalan doesn&apos;t allow to set the public and system IDs dynamically using a variable, when Xalan is used as the default XSLT processor, the output will contain: <codeblock>&lt;!DOCTYPE topic PUBLIC &quot;{$publicid}&quot; &quot;{$systemid}&quot;&gt;</codeblock><p>Suggest to use Saxon as the processor to fix this problem. For other information on this problem, see the section &quot;Other general migration notes&quot; in the first developerWorks article.</p></li>
        <li>Currently, the stylesheet can&apos;t handle HTML files within namespace like below: <codeblock>&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;</codeblock><note>This limitation has been fixed in release 1.2.1, please refer to the <xref href="DITA-h2d.xml"/> for detail information.</note></li>
