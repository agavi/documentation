  <title>Building DITA output with Ant</title>
  <shortdesc>Ant is an open tool that uses the DITA processes to make producing 
    DITA output easier.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction of Ant </b>
    </p>
    <p>DITA provides a set of XSLT scripts for producing different types of 
      documentations such as: help output in Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, 
      web HTML pages and PDF file. </p>
    <p>To make it easier to call these scripts, the DITA distribution now 
      provides an experimental Ant tool to automatically build the DITA 
      documentations, demos, and samples. </p>
    <p>Ant is a Java-based, open source tool provided by the Apache Foundation 
      to declare a sequence of build actions. Meanwhile, Ant is well suited for 
      development builds as well as document builds. </p>
    <p>It is unnecessary for Ant to set up a build environment to run the DITA 
      XSLT scripts. To run the DITA scripts directly, see the <xref 
      href="DITA-readme.xml">DITA Readme</xref> 
      document.</p>
    <note>The following instructions and the associated <i>build.xml</i> and 
      <i>ditatargets.xml </i> files are for the Java 1.5 (and above), Ant 1.7.1, FOP 
      0.95, and Saxon-B 9.1 releases. These instructions are likely to need 
      some adjustment for other versions of these components and for specific 
      environments.</note>
