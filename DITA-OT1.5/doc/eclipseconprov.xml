  <title>Eclipse Content Provider</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>The Eclipse Content Provider is a new function in IBM DITA toolkit 
      Release 1.1 tool. In former releases, you should transform DITA files to 
      HTMLs before you build them into Eclipse help output. With the Eclipse 
      Content Provider, you do not need to transform DITA files to HTMLs 
      beforehand. This new function will preprocess DITA files and dynamically 
      transform them into HTMLs at runtime.</p>
    <?Pub Caret?>
    <p>During the building process, the Eclipse Content Provider generate 
      plugin.xml. The file plugin.xml provides the definition of one or more 
      tables of contents and locate the contents to display.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of creating an output for the Eclipse Content 
      Provider and view the output in specially designed Eclipse on Windows 
      XP.<ol> <li>Create a directory <b>c:\dita-ot</b> as the output directory 
      for DITA mapfiles.</li> <li>Start the command line interface by choosing 
      <menucascade><uicontrol>Start</uicontrol> 
      <uicontrol>Run</uicontrol></menucascade>.</li> <li>Switch to the 
      directory <b>c:\dita-ot</b>.</li> <li>Enter the following command to 
      build:<codeblock>java -jar lib\dost.jar /i:samples/sequence.ditamap 
      /outdir:out /transtype:eclipsecontent </codeblock></li> <li>Then view all 
      the files under <b>c:\dita-ot</b> and copy these files to the 
      corresponding directory under the plugin directory for Eclipse.</li> 
      <li>Call the specially designed Eclipse to view the output.</li> </ol></p>
