    <title>Other Validation Features</title>
    <body>
      <p>Validation can perform other duties than just checking whether input data conforms to
      a given set of rules. Validation can take care of normalizing the input data if
      multiple formats are allowed. Date formats usually are locale specific and even
      within a given locale, multiple formats are common. The AgaviDateValidator can take
      care of normalizing all these formats and all the application ever gets to see is a
      DateTime object or any other defined format. The same idea can be applied to number
      formats and even to custom validators that can transform an ID into an object
      retrieved from the database.</p>
