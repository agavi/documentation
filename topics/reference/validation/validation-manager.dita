  <title>Validation Manager</title>
  <body>
        <p>The ValidationManager takes care of the whole process of validating input data. Each
            ExecutionContainer has it's own instance, so that the validation process is completely
            isolated. The ValidationMananger collects the validation failures and decides whether
            the whole process is marked as failed or not, depending on the severity of the
            individual incidents.</p>
