    <title>The Action::validate(), Action::validateRead(), Action::validateWrite() methods</title>
    <body>
        <p>The <indexterm>Action::validate()</indexterm>
            <indexterm>Action::validateRead()</indexterm>
            <indexterm>Action::validateWrite()</indexterm>
            <fn>Actually, the correct name is validate&lt;RequestMethod>, so if the application uses
                custom request methods (foo for example), the validate method would be called
                Action::validateFoo()</fn> methods are called in addition to the defined validators
            for a given request method. Action::validate() is called on any request method. These
            methods can be used to perform complex custom validation that only happens in one place.
            If you have any need to reuse that validation code you should consider writing your own
            validator. </p>
        <p>These methods can perform arbitrary validation logic, if they return true, the validation
            is successfull, if the method returns false, validation failed. The validated parameters
            still need to be marked as validated on the ValidationManager.</p>
