      <title>Using validators to sanitize user-submitted comments</title>
      <p>The comments that our users submit are stored in our
      database. We have to make sure these comments follow certain rules and do not include
      hostile content. Let's define our demands that the comments would have to follow:
      <ol>
	<li>The email field must carry a consistent email address. It should be no longer than 255 characters.</li>
	<li>The name must not be empty. If it is, "Anonymous" should be substituted for it before the Action is executed.</li>
	<li>The body of the comment must be no longer than 2000
	characters and only carry plain text with no HTML/Javascript
	allowed, so we have to encode it
	with <apiname>htmlentities()</apiname></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Any comment that follows these rules can be stored and
      displayed safely. If the comment doesn't follow the rules, we
      have to reject it.</p>
      <p>To enforce these rules, we describe them in <filepath>app/modules/Public/validate/PostComments.xml</filepath>:</p>
