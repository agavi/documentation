  <title>The Form Population Filter</title>

    <section><title>The FPF and HTML Entities</title><p>As the FPF parses
    xhtml code as valid XML by default it does not like HTML entities such as
    &amp;nbsp, &amp;copy, so they should be avoided. The general
    recommendation is to serve your pages with an UTF-8 charset that
    eliminates the need for most of those entities as they can be represented
    by regular chars. So instead of &amp;copy use the regular Â© sign. For all
    other entities that don't have a character to display use the numeric
    entities - instead of &amp;nbsp; use &amp;160;. Numeric entities parse
    just fine in XML.</p><p>An alternative way would be to add all entities
    you use to a local DTD or to use the HTML parsing mode, but those have
    their own drawbacks.</p></section>

    <section><title>Advantages</title><p>Because the FPF evaluates the
    resulting HTML code, it is independent from any template engine you might
    want to use and works with all of them. Using the FPF to prefill and
    refill the form data also makes your application immune to XSS injection
    attacks in forms as the FPF handles all escaping. However, other XSS
    injection attacks might still be possible - for example when you display
    user-provided data at any other place.</p></section>
