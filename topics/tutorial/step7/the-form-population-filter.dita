    <section><title>The FPF and HTML Entities</title><p>As the FPF parsed
    xhtml code as valid XML it does not like HTML entities such as &amp;nbsp,
    &amp;copy and the like, so they should be avoided. The general
    recommendation is to serve your pages with an UTF-8 charset that
    eliminates the need for most of those entities as they are just valid
    chars. So instead of &amp;copy use the regular Â© sign. For all other
    entities that don't have a character to display use the numeric entities -
    instead of &amp;nbsp; use &amp;160;. Numeric entities parse just fine in
    XML.</p><p>An alternative way would be to add all entities you use to a
    local DTD or to use the HTML parsing mode, but those have their own
    drawbacks.</p></section>
