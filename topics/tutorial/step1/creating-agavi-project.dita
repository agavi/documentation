  <title>Creating an Agavi Project</title>
  <body>
    <p>Once Agavi is installed on your system, you can begin using the project configuration system
      to manage your projects. This system can be accessed using the <cmdname>agavi</cmdname> shell
      script.</p>
    <section>
      <title>Creating an Empty Agavi Application</title>
      <p>This means that you are ready to create the structure for your new blog application,
        affectionately called "Bloggie" (feel free to give it a less cuddly name if you can't stand
        it; the developers recommend "Incredible Scorpion-Powered Blog Application of Doom").</p>
      <p>To create a project, first create a directory in your webservers document root directory
        where the application will reside. For the tutorial we'll assume that you're using a server
        at localhost and the application directory is named "bloggie". So, if your webservers
        document root is located at <filepath>/srv/www</filepath>, create the directory <filepath
          >/srv/www/bloggie</filepath>, if you're using windows and the document root is at
          <filepath>C:\xampp\</filepath> create <filepath>C:\xampp\bloggie</filepath>. Then change
        to that newly created directory and invoke <cmdname>agavi project-wizard</cmdname>. Some of
        the prompts may seem confusing at firstâ€”don't worry, you will have a chance to explore their
        meaning in more depth after your project is created. For the time being only provide a name
        for the project, a prefix to be used for all project specific classes and just leave the
        defaults for the rest, so press enter when those prompts appear.</p>
