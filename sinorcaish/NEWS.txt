The Sinorcaish stylesheet project gives any web site an attractive, clean-
look interface while maintaining a  separation of style and content to the
greatest possible  extent.  This allows  the web author to  concentrate on
the structure  and content of his  or her documents, rather  than on their
presentation.

The following history is presented in reverse chronological order.  If you
would like to  see a list of detailed changes to  this project, you should

Version 1.0 (1st December, 2004)
--------------------------------

Needed an attractive, clean-look web  site design for a particular project
in November,  2004.  Looked at  a number of  styles available on  the Open
Source Web Design web  site (http://www.oswd.org/) and elsewhere.  Sinorca
(http://www.oswd.org/design/1165/sinorca/) by  Haran Sivakumaran seemed to
be a good starting point.  Sinorca,  in its turn, was based on the Acronis
company web site (http://www.acronis.com/).

Although the Sinorca stylesheet was  quite good, it seemed rather limited:
it did not  allow floating text boxes, did not  really cater for computer-
oriented  documentation (which requires  appropriate styling  for elements
like <code>,  <kbd> and <pre>),  and completely ignored (data)  tables and
many other XHTML elements.

These limitations,  along with  the desire to  update parts of  the visual
interface, led to Sinorcaish:  a complete redesign and reimplementation of
the Acronis look-and-feel.  Wrote  a comprehensive "How to Use Sinorcaish"
sample  document, created  template files  and images,  and  submitted the
result to the Open Source Web Design group in December, 2004.
